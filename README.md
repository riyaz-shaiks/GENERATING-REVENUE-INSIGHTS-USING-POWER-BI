# GENERATING REVENUE INSIGHTS USING POWER-BI

In India, Atliq Grands is the owner of numerous five-star hotels. They have 20 years of experience in the hotel sector. Atliq Grands are losing market share and revenue in the category of luxury/business hotels segment as a result of strategic actions made by rivals and inadequate management decisions. With the help of this analysis the managing director of Atliq Grands wants to implement the business strategies in order to reclaim their market share and income.


# Description

A hospitality company noticed a loss in market share and revenue over the past few months. To understand the cause of this loss, they needed a way to analyze it. So, I created a dashboard in Power BI using three months of data.

• Mockup review and gathering of business requirements.

• Data transformation using Power Query.

• Building metrics using DAX.

• Performed Data Cleaning and Data Modelling.

• Performed Data Processing by adding some customized columns to the data.

• Performed Data visualization to create charts and custom sheets to show the insights.


With the dashboard created, the revenue team of the company was able to gain insights about their revenue trend. This could help them regain their revenue and market share by 20% in the next month.

# Following are some significant data analysis findings that can help in decision-making

Enhance pricing plan: By examining the relationships between occupancy rates, Average Daily Rate(ADR), and Revenue Per Available Room(RevPAR), Atliq Grands can enhance its pricing strategy.They can utilise this information to modify their pricing approach for specific living space categories and during times of high and low demand.


Concentrate on advertising during popular times: According to the data, the data showed that the months of December, January, and February produced the most revenue. By concentrating their marketing efforts on these months, they can increase income and bookings.


Focus on vacationing: The information demonstrated that weekends had more revenue than weekdays, demonstrating the value of leisure travel among customers. They can highlight leisure travel in their marketing initiatives and provide packages and discounts that target this market.


Concentrate on locations offering higher income per booking: Mumbai had the highest revenue per booking, followed by Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Delhi, according to the city analysis. To maximise revenue potential, they can give these locations top priority in their expansion plans and marketing initiatives.
